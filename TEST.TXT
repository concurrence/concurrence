if you want to run the tests please type

PYTHON=python make test

or

PYTHON=stackless make test

If you want the mysql tests to succeed, you need to have mysql installed
and you have to create the concurrence mysql test database (from the test directory):

mysqladmin create concurrence_test -u root -p
cat concurrence_test.sql | mysql -u root -p
